This is great! Simple, clean. Real nice. Great job slecting the inputs from the form. 
That's by prefered way (vs document.getElementById)

If it were style better (baddies 3 across using flex or something) it would be worth showing off in a portfolio
You could also make it calculate a price after each input box changes (onChange) Subtotals could be fun. 

Great Work!
